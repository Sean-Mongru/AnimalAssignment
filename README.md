# AnimalAssignment
This console application involves a set amount of animals. The user is be able to pick which category of animal to separate and has the option to pick if to separate the resulting category via the presence of a tail or not. 

In this program I use simple OOP to achieve my objective. A class of animal is outlined with 3 attributes: Name, Category and Tail. When the program is started, an array of class animal including 11 animals are initialized. I used a fixed array due to the problem issued but a dynamic array such as the one used to sort the animals based on selection criteria was also considered. 

This program was coded in Visual Studio Community 2017 using C# on the .NET Framework 4.6.1.
